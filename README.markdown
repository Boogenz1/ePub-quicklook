A quicklook generator for Mac OS X. 

Designed to extract the cover images from ePub files to use as the file icon, and present a nice overview of the ePub in quicklook.

This generator reads the various parameters directly from the ePub contents - so it will work on books that haven't been imported into iTunes.
